## What is Teochew?

[Teochew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teochew_dialect) is a dialect of 
Chinese with over 25 million speakers worldwide. Outside of China, it is 
among one of the most spoken Chinese varieties only surpassed by 
Mandarin, Cantonese, and Taiwanese/Hokkien. Phonetically, it has not 
changed very much and many vocabularies from Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese 
that originated from China centuries ago still sound similar.

For example, consider 肉 which means flesh. \[Niku\] is one of the common 
Japanese readings borrowed from China along with the character. Compare with 
Teochew \[nek8\] \([POJ spelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pe̍h-ōe-jī)\) 
and Mandarin \[rou4\].
